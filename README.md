# LookOut

LookOut is an application that will allow users to set a time to check-in. Upon a failed check-in, selected contacts are notified of the user's location.

## Main Program

Source files can be found in the lib folder. main.dart establishes the opening screen and connections to the different pages. my_home_page.dart contains the source code for the main page of the application and includes the code for the navigation bar.

## Testing

Test files are located in the test folder and are separated by page. These files are run through flutter to test the layout and functionality of the app. Some functions within the source code may need to be made public for the test files to access them.
